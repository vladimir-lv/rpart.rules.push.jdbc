# rpart.rules.push.jdbc
This is version of rpart.rules.push function for rpart.utils library adopted to RJDBC package. Oroginal version can't populate FRAME table if model generated by RPART has large number of attributes. 
Usage: rpart.rules.push.jdbc(fit, jdbcConnection, rulePrefix = "", tablePrefix = "")

Only one restriction for this version - for each model you have to maintain it's own set of FRAME,RULES and SUBRULES tables.
